<# Employee Directory Web App

A responsive and interactive Employee Directory web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates modern front-end development principles, clean modular code, and user-friendly design. No backend is required; all data is managed in-memory in the browser.

- **Delete Employee**: Remove employees from the directory with confirmation.
- **Search**: Search employees by name or email.
- **Filter**: Sidebar to filter by first name, department, or role.
- **Sort**: Sort employees by first name, department, or role.
- **Pagination**: Choose how many employees to show per page and navigate between pages.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **No Backend Required**: All data is stored in-memory and resets on page reload.
